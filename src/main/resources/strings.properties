MESSAGE_HELP=&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My main purpose is to send you deleted tweets from chosen Twitter users. After pressing <b>Start</b> button you will be presented with two options: <b>Sign in</b> and <b>Manage users</b>.\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Sign in</b> option is beneficial in case you want to get deleted tweets from all the users in your Following list. This way there will be no need to add users you want to stalk manually.\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you opt out and proceed to <b>Manage users</b> option (which is available for both registered and not registered users), you will be able to add users you want to stalk manually. Manage users menu offers 4 buttons: <i>Track all tweets</i> of a user (you'll be getting both actual and deleted tweets), <i>Track deleted tweets</i> (you'll be getting deleted only), <i>Stop tracking users</i> (if you don't want to stalk a particular user anymore) and <i>Back</i>. \n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I highly recommend you also take a look at commands by typing a "/" character in the chat field.\n\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Note:</b> you can add twitter users manually even if you don't follow them, except for the protected accounts. You won't be getting notifications from any (followed by you or not) protected accounts.
MESSAGE_DELETE_ERROR=You need to follow someone to be able to perform deletion.
MESSAGE_API_LIMIT=Twitter API generally allows one user to make 15 calls per 15 minutes. It seems that you have reached that limit. Please, wait 15 minutes before refreshing your following list or making other requests.
